Here are some key things to look for when making this critical decision:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Experience and expertise. Any contractor you choose must have extensive experience working on roofs, including commercial and residential buildings. This will ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to provide quality artistry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Reputation. Before hiring any contractor, it is essential to do your research and read reviews from past clients. Ideally, you want to find a roofing contractor with a strong track record of delivering high-quality work and excellent customer service.

When comparing quotes from different contractors, consider the quality of their work and any additional fees or hidden costs associated with the project.
